# blinky
Little name badge sized PCB to make LEDs go blinky, using an ATTINY13A and a CR2032 battery.  

My first proper microcontroller and PCB design, made for a convention that I ended up not attending. Hopefully it can be of use to others out there.

## Programming
I use an adapter like [this](https://pl.aliexpress.com/item/1005005300697130.html) for programming. I use a USBASP adapter and avrdude, but an Arduino as ISP or other ISP programmer should work too.
