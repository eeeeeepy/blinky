# blinky
Little name badge sized PCB to make LEDs go blinky, using an ATTINY13A and a CR2032 battery.  

My first proper microcontroller and PCB design, made for a convention that I ended up not attending. Hopefully it can be of use to others out there.

## Programming

I use a 6 pin, 1,27mm pitch pogo pin adapter like [this](https://pl.aliexpress.com/item/1005005732753061.html) for programming. You could also solder wires to the pads, or use something else with the same pitch. Any ISP programmer, such as USBASP or Arduino as ISP should work.
